# Global-Earthquake-Analytics-Dashboard

üåç Overview

This project is designed to perform a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process on earthquake data, analyze the processed data, and provide a dynamic UI for statistical insights and predictions. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive tool for monitoring, understanding, and forecasting seismic activities.

üöÄ Features

ETL Process:

Extract: Web scraping real-time earthquake data from official geological websites.

Transform: Clean, structure, and enrich data to fit the database schema.

Load: Insert transformed data into a PostgreSQL database with automated connection handling.

Data Analysis:

Analyze historical and real-time data for trends.

Calculate key statistics such as frequency, magnitude distribution, and regional patterns.

Generate data-driven insights to support earthquake risk assessment.

UI & Visualization:

Interactive dashboard for real-time earthquake statistics.

Visualize trends using graphs, heatmaps, and geospatial charts.

Predictive models to forecast seismic activities based on historical data.
